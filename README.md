# Airbnb pricing assisstant üè° ü§ñ

How my company should set up pricing based on competitors? 

In this project we help [LivinParis](livinparis.com), a luxury rental apartment company based in Paris, to benchmark the pricing of their main competitors to give actionable guidance on pricing strategy


This data app shows an interactive data explorer that allow LivinParis to adjust parameters like months and bedrooms to observe in near real-time updates to data visualization.
